## How to get started

### Development

So you want to start contributing to the ArkEcosystem repositories. You must have favorites programming languages / frameworks : go to the [ArkEcosystem](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem) organization page and browse the repositories looking for the one(s) that fits you.

Now that you have chosen one or more repos, here is what you can do to get started :
- Check the open issues. If you find something you would be comfortable developing, go for it. If not :
- Set up your development environment, and start using the product : go through the use cases, test it. You might find a bug or something you can improve.
- You can also check the closed issues to see what's been done : it can give you some ideas on what to do next.

When you've found something to work on, check and follow the GitHub workflow (link).

### Documentation

The documentation topics are organized in the Github [project page](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/docs/projects/1) : you can go there and check the ones that are in status "Open".

If there's one topic you want to write, contact **boldninja** on [Slack](https://ark.io/slack) and ask him if you can take it. If you have examples of things you wrote (a blog, a doc on GitHub, ...), send it to him.

When you have confirmation that you can work on a subject, you can start and follow the GitHub workflow (link).

Remember that quality is key if you want to get your writing approved.

## Github workflow

To go through this workflow, you must have a GitHub account. You must also have Git installed on your computer.

### Fork the repository

To fork the repository, go to its GitHub page and click on the "Fork" button :

It should take a few seconds for your fork to be ready !

So now you have your own repository you can work on.

### Git clone to get the files locally

To get your local copy of your repository, you have to run the Git clone command :

    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
    
   This will get you the files from the repository in a local folder.

### Work locally and push changes to your repo

Now you can work, create and modify files. Once you're satisfied with your changes you can commit :

    git commit -m "This is my awesome commit !"

And push your changes :

    git push

### Submit your changes : PR request

Before you make a PR request, please (if applicable) check that :
- Tests are passing : run `yarn test`
- The code follows the coding standards : run `yarn lint`

Finally, to submit your PR, go to the Ark repository on GitHub.

GitHub might auto detect that you want to create a pull request and suggest it to you :

If not you can do it manually :

### Additional tips

#### Keep your fork synced

The Ark repositories are updated on a regular basis with new PRs. So you need to keep your fork synced in order to have the latest changes.

To do that, please follow this Github doc : [Syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).
